# Your Yearly Vision

This is a thought exercise for aligning with yourself, intended to be completed yearly. It will take a good half-day to complete. For more information, see the [README](README.md); thanks/credit goes to [Andy Drish](https://andydrish.com/) for publishing this exercise in 2015.

## Step 1: Reflect on the previous year
_Take 30-60 min to explore the highs and lows of your previous year. If there are lessons you can distill from those experiences, jot those down under 'Lessons Learned'_
* Highs:

* Lows:

* Lessons Learned:


### Conclude Step 1

* Looking at this list, what I intend to *take with me into next year* is:

* Looking at this list, what I intend to *leave in last year* is:

## Step 2: Take inventory of the present
_Take no more than ten minutes to expound on each aspect of your life and give it a rating on a scale from one to ten, where ten is the best_

_Pick your own topics to talk about, the following list (in alphabetical order) contains suggestions:_

* Career
* Family
* Friendships
* Health
* Love
* Personal Development
* Philanthropy
* Quality of Life
* Sexuality
* Spirituality

## Step 3: Create your vision for the future
_This step is about working backwards from the "far-off" future to align with yourself as you continue to unfold. Take as much time as you need_

In three-to-five years:
* Who do you want to be?
* How will you feel?
* Who do you want to spend your time with?
* What does your live life look like? How's your health?
* What's your perfect day?

One year from today:
* How will your life be different? What will you have done to move yourself along the trajectory of the genuine you?
* How will you be more free?
* How will you feel?
* How will people experience you?
* What is the most exciting thing in your life?

And finally..
### My motto for the coming year is:
