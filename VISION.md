# Your Yearly Vision

This is a thought exercise for aligning with yourself, intended to be completed yearly. It will take a good half-day to complete. For more information, see the [README](README.md); thanks/credit goes to [Andy Drish](https://andydrish.com/) for publishing this exercise in 2015.

## Step 1: Reflect on the previous year
_Take 30-60 min to explore the highs and lows of your previous year. Go through your materials, like your calendar or photos, to remind yourself of memories and experiences. If there are lessons you can distill from those experiences, jot those down under 'Lessons Learned'_
* Highs:

* Lows:

* Lessons Learned:


### Conclude the previous year

* Looking at this list, what I intend to *take with me into next year* is:

* Looking at this list, what I intend to *leave in last year* is:

## Step 2: Take inventory of the present
_Take no more than ten minutes to expound on each aspect of your life and give it a rating on a scale from one to ten, where ten is the best_

_Pick your own topics to talk about, the following list (in alphabetical order) contains suggestions:_

* Body Health
* Career
* Emotional Well-being
* Family
* Finances
* Friendships
* Hobbies and Leisure
* Love
* Mental Health
* Personal Development
* Philanthropy
* Quality of Life
* Romance
* Sexuality
* Spirituality

## Step 3: Create your vision for the future
_This step is about working backwards from the "far-off you" wish for yourself to align yourself for the coming year. For the prompts, take time to let your thoughts flow. Limit your time to 30 minutes if you think you'll go nuts. Then take a step back, perhaps drink a coffee or a glass of water. Come back to your vision and distill all of these thoughts into a motto for your upcoming year!_

In three-to-five years:
* Who do you want to be?
* How will you feel?
* Who do you want to spend your time with?
* What does your love life look like? How's your health?
* What's your perfect day?

One year from today:
* How will your life be different? What will you have done to move yourself along the trajectory of the genuine you?
* How will you be more free?
* How will you feel?
* How will people experience you?
* What is the most exciting thing in your life?

And finally..
### My motto for the coming year is:
